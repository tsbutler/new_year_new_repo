new_year_new_repo
Trying to get myself into more of an always be coding sort of mood, so I'm trying to do a little something everyday.  This is a stunted attempt at such a thing.

Okay.  Apparently, I still know how to create a github repo and clone it locally.  Now I'm going to see if I can commit and push and all that fun stuff.  Wish me luck.

So far this is just me practicing my vim skills.  I know this is a BS commit, but I'm still working on a project, so this is at least keeping me honest here...more or less.

Okay, so yet again, this is a BS entry.  I'm still trying to find a project.  Maybe I can start writing them here.  Nah.  I just need to pick something.  Well, the habit of being here is forming at least.

No project just yet, but the habit is still intact.  I'm thinking of trying to get started with a utility or a game a month.  We'll see.

Alright, so this still isn't turning into a project, but my thought is this, maybe I can use this to track tech reading too, so I'm not always chained to generating some BS bit of code.  Anyhow, thought.

Well, again, not turning into a project, but as the last line indicates, I'm heading in a direction now.  Just need to start doing it.  Updating this is on its way to becoming a habit.  Now to do
something with that habit.  Yeesh.

Okay, so still no projects have materialized.  However, I've gotten a bit better at sorting out what I plan to do with this random file.  Ever onward.
