new_year_new_repo
Trying to get myself into more of an always be coding sort of mood, so I'm trying to do a little something everyday.  This is a stunted attempt at such a thing.

Okay.  Apparently, I still know how to create a github repo and clone it locally.  Now I'm going to see if I can commit and push and all that fun stuff.  Wish me luck.

So far this is just me practicing my vim skills.  I know this is a BS commit, but I'm still working on a project, so this is at least keeping me honest here...more or less.
